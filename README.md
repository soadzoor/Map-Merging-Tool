A simple tool to merge your texture maps.

Ambient occlusionmap, roughnessmap and metalnessmap each use only one channel (Red, Green, Blue) in an image. This tool can be used to merge these channels into a single image.

Only JPGs and PNGs are supported! If at least one of the image is PNG, then the merged image will be PNG. Otherwise it will be JPG.

All the imagemaps should be the same size in dimensions!
