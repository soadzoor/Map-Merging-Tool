A simple tool to merge your texture maps.

Ambient occlusionmap, roughnessmap and metalnessmap each use only one channel (Red, Green, Blue) in an image. This tool can be used to merge these channels into a single image.

Only JPGs and PNGs are supported! If at least one of the images is PNG, then the merged image will be PNG. Otherwise it will be JPG.

All the imagemaps must be the same size in dimensions to get a proper merged image!
